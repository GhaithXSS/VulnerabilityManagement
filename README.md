Vulnerability Management Project
Introduction
Welcome to the Vulnerability Management Project repository. This project demonstrates a practical approach to identifying and managing vulnerabilities in a network using Nessus, a widely recognized vulnerability assessment tool.

In this project, we set up a physical Windows machine as the target system and a Kali Linux instance running on VirtualBox as the scanning system. By leveraging Nessus, we conduct thorough scans of the Windows machine to identify potential security weaknesses, classify them based on severity, and provide actionable remediation steps.

This repository contains detailed documentation, screenshots, and code snippets to guide you through the setup, execution, and analysis phases of the vulnerability management lifecycle.# VulnerabilityManagement
Installing Nessus on Kali Linux
The first step in our vulnerability management project is to download and install Nessus on the Kali Linux machine. Nessus is a powerful tool for vulnerability assessment, and installing it on Kali Linux allows us to scan our target Windows machine for vulnerabilities.

Step-by-Step Installation
Download Nessus Package:
We begin by downloading the Nessus package suitable for our system. For this project, we used the Nessus Debian package for 64-bit systems.

Install Nessus:
Use the following command to install the downloaded Nessus package:

sudo dpkg -i nessus-10.7.3-debian10_amd64.deb

Start Nessus Service:
After the installation is complete, start the Nessus service with the following command:

/bin/systemctl start nessusd.service

By completing these steps, Nessus is successfully installed and running on our Kali Linux machine, ready to be configured for scanning.
