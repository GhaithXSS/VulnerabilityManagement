# Vulnerability Management Project
## Introduction
Welcome to the Vulnerability Management Project repository. This project demonstrates a practical approach to identifying and managing vulnerabilities in a network using Nessus, a widely recognized vulnerability assessment tool.

In this project, we set up a physical Windows machine as the target system and a Kali Linux instance running on VirtualBox as the scanning system. By leveraging Nessus, we conduct thorough scans of the Windows machine to identify potential security weaknesses, classify them based on severity, and provide actionable remediation steps.

This repository contains detailed documentation, screenshots, and code snippets to guide you through the setup, execution, and analysis phases of the vulnerability management lifecycle.
# VulnerabilityManagement
## Installing Nessus on Kali Linux
The first step in our vulnerability management project is to download and install Nessus on the Kali Linux machine. Nessus is a powerful tool for vulnerability assessment, and installing it on Kali Linux allows us to scan our target Windows machine for vulnerabilities.

**Download Nessus Package:**
We begin by downloading the Nessus package suitable for our system. For this project, we used the Nessus Debian package for 64-bit systems.

**Install Nessus:**
Use the following command to install the downloaded Nessus package:

```sudo dpkg -i nessus-10.7.3-debian10_amd64.deb ```
 
**Start Nessus Service:**
After the installation is complete, start the Nessus service with the following command:

![image](https://github.com/GhaithXSS/VulnerabilityManagement/assets/172057297/7cd73fb7-80c2-40a5-9852-adb4f46357ce)

```/bin/systemctl start nessusd.service```

By completing these steps, Nessus is successfully installed and running on our Kali Linux machine, ready to be configured for scanning.

# Accessing Nessus Through the Web Browser
Once Nessus is installed and the service is started, the next step is to access the Nessus web interface to configure and initiate scans.

## Accessing the Nessus Web Interface

**Navigate to Nessus Web Interface:**

Type the following URL in the address bar:
```https://kali:8834/```

**Register for Nessus Essentials:**

To activate Nessus, you need to register for a Nessus Essentials account. Visit the Nessus Essentials registration page to get an activation code.

**Activate Nessus:**

Enter the activation code in the Nessus web interface. This step is required to unlock the full functionality of Nessus Essentials.

**Wait for Plugins to Download and Compile:**

Nessus will begin downloading and compiling plugins. This process may take some time. Once completed, the Nessus web interface will be ready for use.

# Configuring Network Adapter and Testing Connectivity

To ensure that Nessus on the Kali Linux machine can scan the Windows host machine, we need to configure the network settings and verify connectivity.

## Changing Network Adapter to Bridged Mode
In VirtualBox, select your Kali Linux virtual machine and open the settings.Navigate to the "Network" section, and set the "Attached to" field to "Bridged Adapter". This allows the virtual machine to appear as a separate device on the network.

## Testing Connectivity to Windows Host Machine
**Ping the Windows Host Machine:**

Use the ping command to test connectivity to the Windows host machine.

```ping 192.168.1.16```

By configuring the network adapter to bridged mode and verifying connectivity with a ping test, we ensure that the Kali Linux machine can communicate with the Windows host machine, which is essential for conducting vulnerability scans

# Performing a Vulnerability Scan
After setting up Nessus and verifying connectivity, I proceeded to perform a vulnerability scan on the Windows host machine.

**Choosing the Scan Template**

I opened the Nessus web interface and navigated to the "Scan" tab.In the "Scan" tab, I found various scan templates. For this project, I selected the "Basic Network Scan" template.

**Configuring the Basic Network Scan**
In the "Basic Network Scan" configuration page, I provided the following details:

Scan Name: Windows-Scan.

Description: Fully scan the Windows system for vulnerabilities.

Folder: Left it as default (My Scans).

Targets: Entered the IP address of the Windows machine (192.168.1.16).

**Setting Scan Options: Discovery**

In the scan configuration page, I went to the "Discovery" section.For the scan type, I chose "Scan all ports" to ensure a comprehensive scan of the target machine.

**Selecting Plugins**

In the "Plugins" section, I selected the "Windows" plugins, which contain a wide range of known vulnerabilities for Windows systems.

# Executing and Analyzing the Scan
After configuring the scan, I initiated the vulnerability scan and analyzed the results.

## Executing the Scan

**Scan in Progress:**

I initiated the scan, and Nessus began scanning the Windows host machine. The scan interface displays a donut chart indicating the progress and categorization of vulnerabilities found, which can be divided into five categories: Info, Low, Medium, High, and Critical.

## Viewing Scan Results

**Scan Complete:**

Once the scan was complete, Nessus presented the results. In this case, the scan identified 1 Low vulnerability and 1 Medium vulnerability.

## Detailed Vulnerability Information

**Vulnerability Details:**

By clicking on a specific vulnerability, Nessus provides detailed information about the vulnerability, including its description and potential solutions.

By following these steps, I successfully performed a vulnerability scan on the Windows host machine, identified potential security issues, and reviewed detailed information and remediation steps for the discovered vulnerabilities.

# Generating a Report

After analyzing the scan results, I generated a report to document the vulnerabilities found on the scanned host.

## Generating a PDF Report
**Generate Report:**

To generate a report, I navigated to the scan results and selected the option to export the findings. I chose PDF format to create a comprehensive report on the identified vulnerabilities.

# Mitigating Vulnerabilities

To address the identified vulnerabilities, I focused on mitigating the "SMB signing not required" vulnerability.

## Fixing the SMB Signing Not Required Vulnerability

**Open Local Group Policy Editor:**

On the Windows machine, I pressed Windows + R to open the Run dialog, typed gpedit.msc, and pressed Enter. This opened the Local Group Policy Editor.

**Navigate to Security Options:**

In the Local Group Policy Editor, I navigated to:

Computer Configuration -> Windows Settings -> Security Settings -> Local Policies -> Security Options

**Enable SMB Signing:**

I searched for the policy Microsoft network server: Digitally sign communications (always) and set it to Enabled. This action mitigated the "SMB signing not required" vulnerability.

# Verifying the Fix

After applying the fix, I performed another scan to ensure the vulnerability was resolved.

## Performing a Follow-Up Scan

**Rescan the Host:**

I initiated another scan on the Windows host machine to verify that the SMB vulnerability was fixed.

**Scan Results:**

The follow-up scan confirmed that the medium SMB vulnerability was gone, leaving only a low vulnerability regarding multiple Ethernet drivers, which was determined to be a false positive.


By following these steps, I was able to generate a detailed report, mitigate a critical vulnerability, and verify the effectiveness of the applied fix.

# Conclusion

In this project, I demonstrated the process of vulnerability management using Nessus, a powerful tool for identifying and addressing security weaknesses in a network environment.

Through detailed documentation, screenshots, and step-by-step instructions, I illustrated how to:

**Install and configure Nessus on Kali Linux.**

**Perform vulnerability scans on the target Windows machine.**

**Analyze scan results and generate comprehensive reports.**

**Mitigate identified vulnerabilities using practical solutions**.

**By following these guidelines, users can enhance the security of their network infrastructure and proactively address potential security threats.**
