# Vulnerability Management Project
## Introduction
Welcome to the Vulnerability Management Project repository. This project demonstrates a practical approach to identifying and managing vulnerabilities in a network using Nessus, a widely recognized vulnerability assessment tool.

In this project, we set up a physical Windows machine as the target system and a Kali Linux instance running on VirtualBox as the scanning system. By leveraging Nessus, we conduct thorough scans of the Windows machine to identify potential security weaknesses, classify them based on severity, and provide actionable remediation steps.

This repository contains detailed documentation, screenshots, and code snippets to guide you through the setup, execution, and analysis phases of the vulnerability management lifecycle.

## Installing Nessus on Kali Linux
The first step in our vulnerability management project is to download and install Nessus on the Kali Linux machine. Nessus is a powerful tool for vulnerability assessment, and installing it on Kali Linux allows us to scan our target Windows machine for vulnerabilities.

**Download Nessus Package:**
We begin by downloading the Nessus package suitable for our system. For this project, we used the Nessus Debian package for 64-bit systems.

**Install Nessus:**
Use the following command to install the downloaded Nessus package:

```bash sudo dpkg -i nessus-10.7.3-debian10_amd64.deb ```
 
**Start Nessus Service:**
After the installation is complete, start the Nessus service with the following command:

```bash /bin/systemctl start nessusd.service```

By completing these steps, Nessus is successfully installed and running on our Kali Linux machine, ready to be configured for scanning.

# Accessing Nessus Through the Web Browser
Once Nessus is installed and the service is started, the next step is to access the Nessus web interface to configure and initiate scans.

## Accessing the Nessus Web Interface
**Navigate to Nessus Web Interface:**
Type the following URL in the address bar:
```bash https://kali:8834/```
**Register for Nessus Essentials:**
To activate Nessus, you need to register for a Nessus Essentials account. Visit the Nessus Essentials registration page to get an activation code.

**Activate Nessus:**
Enter the activation code in the Nessus web interface. This step is required to unlock the full functionality of Nessus Essentials.

**Wait for Plugins to Download and Compile:**
Nessus will begin downloading and compiling plugins. This process may take some time. Once completed, the Nessus web interface will be ready for use.
